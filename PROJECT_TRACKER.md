# Project Tracker

## Current state
Core idea received on 2026-10-02. Project name: RepoRadar. Repository: SumukhaK/open-source-projectFinder (private initially). Confirmed stack: Python FastAPI, React mobile client, Milvus, GitHub Search API. Detailed brainstorming remains pending.

## Workflow preparation
- [x] Read Karpathy guidelines and extract additional reusable engineering instructions.
- [x] Create AGENTS.md.
- [x] Preserve the initial workflow prompt below.
- [ ] Complete end-to-end project brainstorming and receive the project-specific prompt.
- [ ] Extract technical requirements, scope, decisions, and unresolved questions.
- [ ] Define feature phases, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and verification checks.
- [x] Create README.md with planned architecture and selected tools, REQUIREMENTS.md, and SCOPE.md.
- [x] Establish the GitHub repository identity and initialize the repository.
- [ ] Implement features through TDD, feature branches, pull requests, review, and merge.

## Feature phase tracking
Populate after project scope is established. For each feature record phase, status (planned / in progress / in review / blocked / complete), dependencies, acceptance criteria, tests and results, branch, PR, and documentation updates. Record blockers and unresolved questions explicitly.

## Initial workflow prompt (verbatim)

```text
here are some common instruction i use every time i build a project with AI. read them most of them are inspired from karpathy-guidelines u already inherited, so add whats missed out. once im done brainstorming project  idea end to end i shall give you project specific prompt instructions.

 you act like a a senior software architect, go through this prompt and extract whats suitable for agent.md from them and add them there and take rest of the informations as project requirements and implementation guidelines. once done reading, analyse it deeply, plan the project and features to implement in each phases of the project and record them in a md file in project folder and update them as we accomplish implemntation of each phases. record this initial prompt as well in that tracker md. update the project readme with a high level of architecture diagram of what we are planning to do and update the same readme with short details as we implement each phase succesfully. Think and analyse before acting, read the existing code before making edits or updates. if there s a bug, read the code, understand and then plan before fixing it. fixing one bug should not break existing and working parts of the project. Create a remote repo in my github with a readme file and push code feature by feature by creating branches and merge them once its reviewed by you. In project readme, keep high level architecure diagram, project s brief descrption, tools and libraries used. Create a separate readme for project requirement in techincal terms and a separate readme for explaining the project and its scope to non technical people, another tracker file where you mention the planned phases of this multi agent system and put tracker with them to mark it for update as we continue to execute the project.

use TDD, write unit tests before writing actaul code. divide tasks into features and write code accordingly and push them to git with approriate commmit messages. each feature should first open a PR in git. Review the code and merge if its fine, if it changes the status to "Request changes" act on them accordingly. also the code should be simple, human readable and human understandable format. do not assume anything, do not make up anything. ask if confused. keep all the api keys and sensitive data in env and do not push them. keep all configurations related settings in one file and at one place.
```

## Project-specific prompt
```text
feel free to create a remote git repo with the name "open-source-projectFinder" or come up with some cool nickname for the project and use it as github project. we are going to build an AI driven backend and a front end mobile app in react for it as a client. our ultimate goal is to let user share their project idea using voice or text using app, backend will go through github public repo s to see if similiar idea is already implemented. we are going to use milvus vector db to store massive data we download from git periodically and also use github search api to give hybrid search advantage to our users. this is the core idea, details i will share later, use this to plan folder structures withinh the laptop file system and git repo and add a project level readme, figure out a catchy name and push the empty project repo to github. we will stick with python fast api s for backend
```

## Preliminary phases (revise after brainstorming)

| Phase | Features | Status | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Repository, folder scaffold, architecture and scope documents | Complete | Diff reviewed; secret exclusions verified; pushed scaffold PR #1; GitGuardian check passed |
| 1 | Finalize requirements, API contract, providers and evaluation criteria | Planned | Agreed acceptance criteria and recorded decisions |
| 2 | Text idea submission and GitHub search baseline | Planned | Unit tests first, API integration checks, relevant results |
| 3 | Periodic ingestion, embeddings and Milvus index | Planned | Repeatable ingestion, deduplication, updates and retrieval checks |
| 4 | Hybrid retrieval, ranking and AI similarity explanations | Planned | Agreed relevance evaluation, provenance and failure handling |
| 5 | Mobile text discovery flow | Planned | Client tests and end-to-end submission/results verification |
| 6 | Voice submission and transcription | Planned | Voice-to-search flow and privacy/error behavior verification |
| 7 | Scale validation and deployment readiness | Planned | Agreed performance, reliability and deployment checks |

These phases are provisional. No dependencies or application code have been installed. React Native is proposed, not finalized. Future feature entries must record branches, PRs, test results and documentation changes.


## Phase 0 review record
Branch: chore/project-scaffold. PR: https://github.com/SumukhaK/open-source-projectFinder/pull/1. Reviewed documentation and directory boundaries; no application tests apply to this documentation-only scaffold. Verified environment files are ignored and no runtime secrets are tracked. Merge follows final whitespace validation and remote checks.

## Branding decision - 2026-10-02

User selection: Bracket Navigator. Saved the chosen concept board and documented the blue/navy direction, dark/light modes, and platform-specific launch/icon requirements in docs/BRANDING.md. Branch: docs/bracket-navigator-brand. Decision and reference preservation complete; production exports and mobile integration remain part of the mobile phase. Verification: reviewed concept and documentation, confirmed reference file exists, and checked diff whitespace. No application tests apply to this asset/documentation update.

User follow-up: 'and use app icon bracket navigator as loading animation throughout the app'. Added the shared loading requirement to technical requirements and branding guidance. Proposed motion: stationary brackets with a gently moving needle; final timing and reusable mobile component remain pending. PR: https://github.com/SumukhaK/open-source-projectFinder/pull/2.
